# Project exam 1 - SmoothieBowls

A blog about healthy smoothie bowls. created in connection with a project exam at school.

## Description

In the Project 1 exam, we were tasked to create a blog site. This five-week project shows what we have learned during the first year in front-end development. The theme of the blog is healthy smoothie bowl recipes. The blog includes a homepage, an About page, a list of blog posts, blog post-specific pages, and a contact page. I have used Figma to make a prototype for the blog. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to develop the blog. WordPress is used as API to get the smoothie recipes and images.
